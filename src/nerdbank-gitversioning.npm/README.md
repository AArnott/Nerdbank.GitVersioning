Nerdbank.GitVersioning
======================

With this package, and a version.json file to express your version number
checked into the root of your git repo:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0-beta"
}
```

Your NPM packages and other builds can be automatically stamped with a
version that precisely describes the git commit that built it.

See our [project README][GitHubREADME] for more information.
